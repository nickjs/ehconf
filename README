A CONF, EH?

a pseudo fork of https://github.com/maxogden/tacoconf from before it was cool to have their code on github.
originally inspired as satire of http://tacoconf.com, this is now a 100% real web conference celebrating everything canadian, stereotypical and otherwise.
more details as well as dates and ticket information is coming soon.

you are encouraged to fork max ogden's original and use it to run your own css3 floating object parallax based decentralized micro conference extravaganza
